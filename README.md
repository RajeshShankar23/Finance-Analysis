# Finance-Analysis
# Business Problem
We will be playing the part of a new financial analyst for an aerospace manufacturing firm called Spaero Technology.
The dataset is made up of fictional sales data from 2015 until 2021. It follows a star schema, which means it centers around a main table called a fact table and has other tables, called dimension tables, that organize related data. In this data model, the Sales_Fact table holds all transactional data for each sale made, and Customer_Dim contains some more of the customer information.

# Approach Used:

In this financial analytics report for Spaero Technology, we employed various analytical techniques and methodologies to provide insights into the company's financial performance, customer analytics, scenario analysis, and capital budgeting. We utilized key performance indicators (KPIs), objectives and key results (OKRs), and analytical frameworks such as profitability analysis, scenario forecasting, sensitivity analysis, future value calculations, and capital budgeting techniques.

# Insights:

Profitability Analysis: Identified the product with the highest net income and profit margin, highlighting potential pricing strategies to increase sales volume.

Revenue Performance: Analyzed revenue performance over time and compared it to targets, revealing trends and areas for improvement.
